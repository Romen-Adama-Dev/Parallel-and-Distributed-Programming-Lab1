Doubts and problems encountered when carrying out the exercise.
1st, I have not managed to execute the sequence of doubles, because I do not quite understand how to use them with the rand().
I tried to use the fmod function to calculate the module and apply it as I did with the integers, but to no avail.
2nd, I managed to create and use a txt where to store data, but I can't understand why, instead of printing all the successions of "l", 
it only prints the last one. 
3ยบ, due to these problems I have not had enough time to try to do the last exercise. 
If you read this README, I would like to be able to arrange a tutorial to try to complete the failed tasks and finish the missing one.

Atte,
Romen Adama
